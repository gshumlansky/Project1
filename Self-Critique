For the overall structure of the site I tried to match the IIT red format. At first there were accessibility issues while reading the site due to the dark shade of red, so I gave the site a tint of red without being disruptive. I also chose the font, Georgia, as it was different from the basic fonts but was still simple and recognizable. I made the file layout as simple as possible by clearly listing out the page titles and added sections into a separate folder to make navigating the files easier. Initially I struggled with nested loops, figures, and the background colors for the text wouldn’t align. Eventually I was able to troubleshoot the issues which then fixed some design bugs I had with the site. I then decided to remove the background color as it was tricky to read in the first place. With more time I would make the navigation bar prettier as it doesn’t bring any aesthetic value to the site and I would also add some of the icons and gifs to try and break up the long paragraphs of text.
